This Python script creates a menu-driven assistant that can perform various tasks:
Open system applications and settings
Launch web services like WhatsApp
Send emails
Simulate SMS sending
Interact with ChatGPT
Retrieve geolocation information
Fetch Twitter trends
The program uses a simple text-based interface, allowing users to select options from a menu. It incorporates external libraries and APIs for advanced features like email, geolocation, and social media integration. Some functions (SMS, ChatGPT, and Twitter trends) require additional setup or API keys to work properly.
The code is structured with separate functions for each task, making it easy to maintain and expand. It demonstrates basic input/output operations, system command execution, web browser control, and API interactions, providing a foundation for building more complex assistant applications.
